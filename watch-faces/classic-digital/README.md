# Blose classic digital wath face

A sample watch face for Watch Face Studio

The watch face is intended to be used together with Blose WearOS app. 

The sample screenshot shows what the watch face will look like, when the background
complication is configured to show Graph complication from Blose. The lower left
complication is configured to show Glucose and trend complication from Blose. 
The complications below glucose and trend are configured to display 
diff/delta and timestamp, also complications from Blose. 

All glucose values in the screenshot are shown in mmol/L. Blose WearOS app can be 
configured to show values in mg/dL. Selecting units is not done in the watch face.

Time/date will be shown in a format recognized by the user.
